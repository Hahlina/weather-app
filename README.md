##Weather App Project

#This is my "Weather App" project, designed to retrieve current weather information for various locations worldwide. It allows users to quickly and easily obtain up-to-date data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather conditions.

#Technologies and Libraries
In this project, I utilized the following technologies and libraries:
 - HTML: Used to create the basic structure of the web page.
 - SCSS: Used for styling and formatting the web page to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
 - Vite: A fast and easy-to-use build and development tool for web applications. It provides quick page reloading during development and optimizes performance for the final deployment.
 - JavaScript: Implemented the functionality of the Weather App, including interaction with the weather API and data processing.
 - OpenWeatherMap API: Integrated to retrieve real-time weather data. To use it, you need to obtain an API key from the OpenWeatherMap website and include it in the project.
 - Moment.js Library: Utilized for working with dates and times, particularly for date formatting.
 - Swiper Library: Incorporated for creating a weather forecast carousel and displaying different slides with information.
 - Firebase: Implemented for user authentication using email and Google accounts, as well as for storing users' favorite cities in the database.
 - SweetAlert2 Library: Utilized for creating modal windows with warnings, success messages, or error alerts, adding interactivity to the project.

#Instructions

- Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP archive.
- Obtain an API key from the OpenWeatherMap website and save it.
- In the script.js file, find the apiKey variable and replace its value with your obtained API key.
- Register on Firebase and set up authentication for email and Google.
- Open the index.html file in a web browser.

#Further Enhancements
In the future, you can expand the functionality of the "Weather App" project by adding the following features:
- Search functionality for specific locations or cities.
- Additional weather parameters such as UV index, precipitation levels, etc.
- Visualization of weather data using charts or diagrams.
